                Hi,my name is Daniel Crew. I was born on July 3rd 1992 in Fayeteville, North Carolina. I only lived
                there for a year and then moved to Anchorage, Alaska where I spent most of my childhood. At the start of
                high school I moved to Colorado and is where I reside to this current day.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies are snowboarding, riding my motorcycle, and playing videogames. Favorite place to snowboard
                is at Keystone. I ride a 2008 Kawasaki ZX6R, also known as a ninja. The video game I currently spend
                most of my time playing is Fortnite.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently I am a fulltime Lyft driver. I do enjoy driving for Lyft since I enjoy meeting new people and
                talking to get to know them. All my time driving Lyft I have failed to meet people who are the same
                which is exciting. Also I am a student at University of Denver and taking a bootcamp for coding. So far
                it is very exciting since I am attending the school and class to start a new career.
